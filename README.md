# TennisProject
Tennis analysis using deep learning and machineÂ learning. <br>

### Ball detection
TrackNet was used for detecting tennis ball during the game. 

### Bounce detection
Autogluons models were used used to predict ball's bounces during the game based on ball trajectory detected in the previous step.

### Court detection
It was used neural network for detection 14 points of tennis court.
